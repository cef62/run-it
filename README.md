This project is an experiment created for my talk at [jsday Italy 2017](https://2017.jsday.it) in Verona.

The basic idea is to create a tool able to fetch scripts from remote repositories and execute them inside the host project. 
`run-it` clones the remote git repositories and install their dependencies for you.

I plan to consolidate the tool and make him production ready, but not very soon.

## The tool works but is far from being complete, use it at your own risk.
